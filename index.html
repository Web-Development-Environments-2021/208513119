          Hey everyone and welcome to my site, actually my first one !
          </br>
          My name is Nelly Edlin I am 83 years old and still counting, I was born in Poltava, Ukraine on the 11th of
          September, 1937.I was born to Elena Vinarsky and Haim Gaysinsky. I have 2 sisters, Maya
          is 85 years old today, she lives nowdays with her family in Berlin, Germany. Nina was my sister but from another
          father and unfortunately she has passed away due to cancer.
          She was only 18 years old, it was shortly after the war ended.
          <br />
          <br />
          I came from a middle-class family, my mom was a Polish woman and a housewife, my dad was a CEO of a Commercial
          Network in Ukraine.
          When World War 2 began, my father as a Ukrainian citizen belonging to the Soviet Union at the time,volunteered to
          go to the war which he never returned from.
          I was only 4 years old when the war came into Ukraine and I remember everything like it was yesterday.
          We were sent to labor camps in Uzbekistan with my mother and my 2 sisters, and survived there all together until
          the war ended and the Red Army won over the Nazis.
          We came back to Poltava after the war ended and we soon became a poor jewish family, moved into basements with
          gypsies.
          When I was 17 I graduated school and went to the university in Poltave, where I recieved my Masters Degree in
          Architecture.
          <br />
          <br />
          While studing in the university I met my husband Gregory. We got married on the 9th of April, 1960. We made an
          Aliyah to Israel in 1995, and we have been married for 61 years!
          We have 2 amazing daughters, Irena and Larisa, 4 lovely grandchildren and even 2 sweetest great-grandchildren.
          My family is the only thing that keeps me alive, I am thankful to God for having what I have in life.
