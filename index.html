      <p>Hey everyone and welcome to my site, actually my first one !
        <br />
        <p>
          My name is Nelly Edlin I am 83 years old and still counting, I was born in Poltava, Ukraine on the 11th of
        September, 1937.I was born to Elena Vinarsky and Haim Gaysinsky. I have 2 sisters, Maya
        is 85 years old today, she lives nowdays with her family in Berlin, Germany. Nina was my sister but from another
        father and she died because of a cancer when
        she was only 18 years old, it was shortly after the war end.
        <br />
        <br />
        I came from a middle-class family, my mom was a Polish woman and a housewife, my dad was a CEO of a Commercial
        Network in Ukraine.
        When World War || began, my father as a Ukrainian citizen belonging to the Soviet Union at the time,volunteered to
        go to the war from which he never returned.
        I was only 4 years old when the war came into Ukraine and I remember everything like it's was yesterday !
        We were sent to labor camps in Uzbekistan with my mother and my 2 sisters, and survived there all together until
        the war ended and the Red Army won the Nazis.
        We came back to Poltava after the war ended and we soon became a poor jewish family, moved into basements with
        gypsies.
        When I was 17 I graduated school and went to the university in Poltave there I recieved my Master Degree in
        Architecture.
        <br />
        <br />
        While studing in the university I met my husband Gregory. We got married on the 9th of April, 1960. We made an
        Aliyah to Israel in 1995, and we are married already 61 years !
        We have 2 amazing daughters, Irena and Larisa, 4 lovely grandchildren and even 2 sweetest great-grandchildren.
        My family is the only thing that keeps me alive, I am thankful to God for having what I have in life.
        </p>
        
      <h1>What are your Hobbies ? </h1>
      As a 83 years old woman I don't have a lot of hobbies, but I have some as:
      <ul>
        <li>Walk around my neighborhood every morning and every evening</li>
        <li>Go to shopping at the center near our house</li>
        <li>To sew</li>
        <li>Solve sudoku</li>
        <li>Interept dreams</li>
      </ul>
      <h1>What Interest you ? </h1>
      As befits to a Polish grandma, everything interests me in everyone's life. I'll give some examples for interesting
      issues in my opinion:
      <ul>
        <li>Astrology</li>
        <li>News</li>
        <li>Politics</li>
        <li>Solve sudoku</li>
        <li>The German "Burda" magazine for sewing</li>
      </ul>
      <h1>Who is your role model ? </h1>
      Joseph Stalin is my role model, I adore him and I own him my life. As a child I was taught to admire Soviet
      education, so at the end of the war
      when the Red-Army liberated us I couldn't stop thank him bacuse he was the leader and a hero for me.
