<p>Hey everyone and welcome to my site, actually my first one !
  <br/>
  My name is Nelly Edlin I am 83 years old and still counting, I was born in Poltava, Ukraine on the 11th of September, 1937.I was born to Elena Vinarsky and Haim Gaysinsky. I have 2 sisters, Maya
  is 85 years old today, she lives nowdays with her family in Berlin, Germany. Nina was my sister but from another father and she died because of a cancer when 
  she was only 18 years old, it was shortly after the war end.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I came from a middle-class family, my mom was a Polish woman and a housewife, my dad was a CEO of a Commercial Network in Ukraine. 
  When World War || began, my father as a Ukrainian citizen belonging to the Soviet Union at the time,volunteered to go to the war from which he never returned.
  I was only 4 years old when the war came into Ukraine and I remember everything like it's was yesterday ! 
  We were sent to labor camps in Uzbekistan with my mother and my 2 sisters, and survived there all together until the war ended and the Red Army won the Nazis.
  We came back to Poltava after the war ended and we soon became a poor jewish family, moved into basements with gypsies.
  When I was 17 I graduated school and went to the university in Poltave there I recieved my Master Degree in Architecture.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While studing in the university I met my husband Gregory. We got married on the 9th of April, 1960. We made an Aliyah to Israel in 1995, and we are married already 61 years !
  We have 2 amazing daughters, Irena and Larisa, 4 lovely grandchildren and even 2 sweetest great-grandchildren. 
  My family is the only thing that keeps me alive, I am thankful to God for having what I have in life.

  <h1>What are your Hobbies ? </h1>
  As a 83 years old woman I don't have a lot of hobbies, but I have some as:
  <ul>
    <li>Walk around my neighborhood every morning and every evening</li>
    <li>Go to shopping at the center near our house</li>
    <li>To sew</li>
    <li>Solve sudoku</li>
    <li>Interept dreams</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>What Interest you ? </h1>
  As befits to a Polish grandma, everything interests me in everyone's life. I'll give some examples for interesting issues in my opinion:
  <ul>
    <li>Astrology</li>
    <li>News</li>
    <li>Politics</li>
    <li>Solve sudoku</li>
    <li>The German "Burda" magazine for sewing</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Who is your role model ? </h1>
  Joseph Stalin is my role model, I adore him and I own him my life. As a child I was taught to admire Soviet education, so at the end of the war 
  when the Red-Army liberated us I couldn't stop thank him bacuse he was the leader and a hero for me.
